Block'Hood Analytics
====================

Block'Hood ([home page](https://www.plethora-project.com/blockhood),
[Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/416210/Blockhood)
is a city-building game by Jose Sanchez of the
[Plethora Project](http://www.plethora-project.com).

I'm unaffiliated. I bought and enjoy the game, so I wrote this application to do some analysis on its economic model.

For details of the development process, see
[making of](https://github.com/reinderien/blockhood/blob/master/makingof.md).

The project also has an
[uploader bot](https://github.com/reinderien/blockhood/blob/master/upload.md)
for the GamePedia wiki to update block pages.
